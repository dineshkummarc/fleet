### Algorithm Used.

I uses this pseudo-code to filter through the stops that passenger will pass through his trip.

```php
    $ride = ['start' => 2, 'end' => 4];

    $trips_i_will_see = [];
    $trips_i_wont_see = [];

    $stations =  [1, 2, 3, 4];

    $stations_count = count($stations);

    for ($i = 0; $i < $stations_count; $i++) {
        for ($x = $i; $x < $stations_count; $x++) {
            if ($i == $x) {
                continue;
            }

            if (
                ($stations[$i] <= $ride['start'] && $stations[$x] <= $ride['start']) ||
                ($stations[$i] >= $ride['end'] && $stations[$x] >= $ride['end'])
            ) {
                $trips_i_wont_see[] = ['start' => $stations[$i], 'end' => $stations[$x]];
                continue;
            }

            $trips_i_will_see[] = ['start' => $stations[$i], 'end' => $stations[$x]];
        }
    }

    dd($trips_i_will_see, $trips_i_wont_see);
```
